# LibMPV.AutoGen

A CSharp binding repository for [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). Use [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp) to generate csharp binding code. The generated code can be found at LibMPVSharp.

## LibMPVSharp.WPF

Provide a wpf control for the MPV (`VideoView`). Rendered using OpenGL. So it doesn't have airspace problems.
